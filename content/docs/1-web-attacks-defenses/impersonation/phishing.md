# Phishing

Phishing is a type of cyber attack that is designed to trick people into giving away sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal information.

The attacker typically uses a variety of tactics to try to fool the victim, such as creating a fake website or email that looks legitimate. These fake sites or emails often ask the victim to enter their personal information, which is then collected by the attacker.

Phishing is so common as it is really difficult for an average user to assess the legitimacy of an email or a website.

## Homograph Attacks

Homograph attack is a type of phishing attack that uses a domain name that looks **similar** to a legitimate domain name, but is actually a different domain name.

This is achieved by using characters that look similar to the legitimate domain name, but are actually different characters.

For example, the letter `a` can be replaced with the letter `à` or `á`, which look similar but are actually different characters.
