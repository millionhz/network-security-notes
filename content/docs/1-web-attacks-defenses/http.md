Cookies are used to hold state information. They are set by the server and are sent back to the server with every request. Cookies usually include session identifiers and authentication information.

However, cookies are susceptible to theft. A hacker can steal a user's cookies from their device and use them to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to their account. This is why it is important to protect your device and use a secure network when using cookies.
