# Qualitative Studies

Qualitative research is a type of research method that focuses on exploring and understanding the subjective experiences and perspectives of individuals.

It is designed to answer questions like "why?" and "how?" by exploring a subject's underlying motivations, attitudes and behaviors.

They typically involves a smaller sample size, allowing researchers to deeply study each participant.

## Qualitative Methods

### Interviews/focus groups

In interviews, a researcher conducts a one-on-one conversation with a participant, while in focus groups, a group of participants are brought together to discuss a particular topic.

Interviews and focus groups allow for in-depth exploration of attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors and can be guided by an interview guideline and open-ended questions.

### Participatory/Contextual Design

Participatory design is a method for integrating prospective users into the design process. This approach aims to involve users in the design process by actively engaging them in co-design activities, such as brainstorming sessions or prototyping exercises.

*Contextual design is a similar to observation studies.*

### Observations

Observations are a method for collecting data by observing participants in their natural environment. This method allows researchers to gather data on behaviors, attitudes, and experiences in a real-world setting

### Diary Studies

Diary studies are a method for collecting data over an extended period of time. Participants are asked to keep a diary or log of their experiences, thoughts, and behaviors related to a particular topic, such as their use of security features.
