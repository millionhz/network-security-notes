# Quantitative Studies

Quantitative research is a type of research that focuses on numerical data and statistical analysis.

It is designed to answer questions like "how many". In order to achieve this goal, quantitative research often relies on larger sample sizes compared to qualitative research

The focus of quantitative research is often on gaining a broad understanding of a particular topic, as opposed to a deep, detailed understanding as is often the case in qualitative research.

## Quantitative Methods

### Eye Tracking

Measuring eye movements and gaze patterns to understand where people are looking and for how long.

### A/B Testing

A/B testing is a method used to compare two versions of a product, design, or process to determine which is more effective.

It involves randomly assigning a sample of users to either the control group (A) or the treatment group (B) and comparing their behavior or outcomes

### Large Scale Surveys

Large-scale surveys are a method used to gather information from a large number of people in order to quantify phenomena.

### Experience Sampling

Experience sampling is a method used to collect data about experiences as they occur in real-time. This can involve adding logging mechanisms to beta-versions of a product in order to measure its performance in the wild.\

This type of data collection allows researchers to understand how people are actually using a product or system, as opposed to how they might describe it in a survey.
