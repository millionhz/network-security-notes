# What is usable security?

Useable security os about making security easy to use for everyone.

## Why is useable security difficult?

- Security workflows are considered secondary and distracts users from their main tasks.

- Useability is often an afterthought when designing products.

- Security is often considered a barrier to onboaring users to a product.

- Security methodologies are developed to keep systems secure and very little importance is paid to useability of the product by the end users.

The key to developing usable security is to consider all humans involved in the development lifecycle. This includes designers, developers, administrators and end users.
