# What is usable security?

Useable security is about making security easy to use for everyone.

## Why is useable security difficult?

- Security workflows are considered secondary and distracts users from their main tasks.

- Useability is often an afterthought when designing products.

- Security is often considered a barrier to onboaring users to a product.

- Security methodologies are developed to keep systems secure and very little importance is paid to useability of the product by the end users.

{{< hint info >}}
The key to developing usable security is to consider all humans involved in the development lifecycle. This includes designers, developers, administrators and end users.
