# Network Layers

| # | Layer | Description |
| - | ----- | ----------- |
| 7 | Application Layer | This layer is responsible for providing access to network services and communication between user applications. |
| 6 | Presentation layer | - |
| 5 | Session Layer | - |
| 4 | Transport Layer | This layer is responsible for the end-to-end delivery of data between two hosts. It provides error detection and correction, flow control, and fragmentation and reassembly of data packets.  |
| 3 | Network layer | This layer is responsible for the logical addressing and routing of data between different networks. It determines the best path for data to travel between networks and handles congestion control. |
| 2 | Data link layer| This layer is responsible for the reliable transmission of data over the physical layer. It is responsible for error detection and correction, flow control, and framing.|
| 1 | Physical | The physical layer is responsible for the physical transmission of data over a network. It defines the hardware and physical characteristics of the network, such as cables, connectors, and signal types. |
