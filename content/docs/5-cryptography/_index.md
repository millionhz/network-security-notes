# Cryptography

- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Authentication

# Kerckhoffs's Principle (Threat Model)

Cryptosystems should remain secure even when the attacker knows all internal details of the system. The key should be the only thing that must be kept secret, and the system should be designed to make it easy to change keys that are leaked (or suspected to be leaked).

# Symmetric vs Asymmetric Cryptography

- Symmetric: Same key for encryption and decryption.
- Asymmetric: Different keys for encryption and decryption.
