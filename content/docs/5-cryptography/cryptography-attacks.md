# Cryptography Attacks

## Ciphertext only

This is a type of attack where an attacker has access to encrypted messages, but not the original plain text or the encryption key.

The goal of the attacker is to decipher the encrypted messages and recover the original plain text.

## Known-plaintext attack

In this type of attack, the attacker has access to both the encrypted message and the corresponding plain text.

The goal of the attacker is to recover the encryption key used to encrypt the message.

## Chosen-plaintext attack

In this type of attack, the attacker can choose a plain text message and obtain the corresponding encrypted message.

The goal of the attacker is to recover the encryption key used to encrypt the message.

## Chosen-ciphertext attack

This is the **most powerful** type of attack where the attacker has access to both the encrypted message and the ability to obtain the corresponding plain text message.

The goal of the attacker is to recover the encryption key used to encrypt the message.
