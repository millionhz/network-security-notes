# Network Security Notes

This repository contains notes and resources for a university course on network security.

## Build Instructions

To build the notes, you need to have [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) installed. Then, run the following command:

```bash
hugo server
```

This will start a local web server on port 1313. You can access the notes at <http://localhost:1313>.
